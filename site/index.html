	<p>SMLUG is a group of computer and technology enthusiasts that meets once a month to promote the free and open philosophy and to share ideas and knowledge. Linux is a free and open source operating system developed under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL). The GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change all versions of a program and to make sure it remains free software for all its users. If you have an interest in learning Linux as a career, or just for personal use, attend the next meeting to find out what the group has to offer.</p>
